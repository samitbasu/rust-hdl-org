# RustHDL

**RustHDL** is a new way to write firmware for FPGAs using the Rust Programming Language as a Hardware Description Language.

* Safe - have Rust check the validity of your firmware with strongly typed interfaces that are checked at *compile* time,
as well as static analyzers, and simulation and synthesis tools to validate your design before you get to the bench.
* Fast - Run simulations of your designs straight from your
Rust code, with pretty good simulation performance.
* Readable - RustHDL outputs Verilog code for synthesis and
implementation, and goes through some effort to make sure that
code is readable and understandable, in case you need to resolve
timing issues or other conflicts.
* Reusable - RustHDL supports templated firmware for parametric
use, as well as a simple composition model based on structs.
* Batteries Included - RustHDL includes a set of basic firmware
widgets that provide FIFOs, RAMs and ROMs, Flip flops, SPI components,
PWMs etc, so you can get started quickly üîã.
* Free - Although you can use RustHDL to wrap existing IP cores,
all of the RustHDL code and firmware is open source and free to use (as in speech and beer üç∫).
* Tested - RustHDL has been used to write firmware that is shipping in commercial products.
This includes quite complicated designs that use nearly all of a moderately sized FPGA,
and take advantage of specialized hardware in the FPGAs themselves ü¶ë.

# Quickstart

If you have never coded in Rust before, I suggest you head over to the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), and
work through that first.  You don't need to be a Rust Wizard ü™Ñ to write firmware using RustHDL.  But I assume you know
the basics.

To add `rust-hdl` to your project, simply create a new project and then add `rust-hdl` as a dependency:
```shell
samitbasu@fedora jnk]$ cargo new testme
     Created binary (application) `testme` package
[samitbasu@fedora jnk]$ cd testme
[samitbasu@fedora testme]$ cargo add rust-hdl
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding rust-hdl v0.38.2 to dependencies.
[samitbasu@fedora testme]$ 
```

To get the most benefit from `rust-hdl` you should probably 
install [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys).
`Yosys` provides more sophisticated checking on the generated Verilog and it also provides some
synthesis pathways for some of the more open-source friendly FPGAs.

Then replace `main.rs` with the following.

```rs
use std::time::Duration;
use rust_hdl::prelude::*;

const CLOCK_SPEED_HZ : u64 = 10_000;

#[derive(LogicBlock)]  // <- This turns the struct into something you can simulate/synthesize
struct Blinky {
    pub clock: Signal<In, Clock>, // <- input signal, type is clock
    pulser: Pulser,               // <- sub-circuit, a widget that generates pulses
    pub led: Signal<Out, Bit>,    // <- output signal, type is single bit
}

impl Default for Blinky {
   fn default() -> Self {
       Self {
         clock: Default::default(),
         pulser: Pulser::new(CLOCK_SPEED_HZ, 1.0, Duration::from_millis(250)),
         led: Default::default(),
       }
    }
}

impl Logic for Blinky {
    #[hdl_gen] // <- this turns the update function into an HDL Kernel that can be turned into Verilog
    fn update(&mut self) {
       // v-- write to the .next member     v-- read from .val() method
       self.pulser.clock.next = self.clock.val();
       self.pulser.enable.next = true.into();
       self.led.next = self.pulser.pulse.val();
    }
}

fn main() {
    // v--- build a simple simulation (1 testbench, single clock)
    let mut sim = simple_sim!(Blinky, clock, CLOCK_SPEED_HZ, ep, {
        let mut x = ep.init()?;
        wait_clock_cycles!(ep, clock, x, 4*CLOCK_SPEED_HZ);
        ep.done(x)
    });

    // v--- construct the circuit
    let uut = Blinky::default();
    // v--- run the simulation, with the output traced to a .vcd file
    sim.run_to_file(Box::new(uut), 5 * sim_time::ONE_SEC, "blinky.vcd").unwrap();
    vcd_to_svg("blinky.vcd","blinky_all.svg",&["uut.clock", "uut.led"], 0, 4 * sim_time::ONE_SEC).unwrap();
    vcd_to_svg("blinky.vcd","blinky_pulse.svg",&["uut.clock", "uut.led"], 900 * sim_time::ONE_MILLISECOND, 1500 * sim_time::ONE_MILLISECOND).unwrap();
}
```

Finally, run this simulation
```shell
[samitbasu@fedora testme]$ cargo run --release
   Compiling testme v0.1.0 (/home/samitbasu/Devel/jnk/testme)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.92s
     Running `target/release/testme`
[samitbasu@fedora testme]$ 
```

You should now have a `vcd` file that can be viewed with a tool like [gtkwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).  Alternately, RustHDL 
includes the ability to generate an `svg` file from the `vcd` file.
This is the end result showing the entire simulation:
![blinky_all](blinky_all.svg)
Here is a zoom in showing the pulse to the LED
![blinky_pulse](blinky_pulse.svg)

# Roadmap

It's difficult to generate an accurate roadmap for a project like RustHDL, given that it's not sponsored and so vast in scope.
Nonetheless, here is the current set of milestones/priorities:

- Documentation!  The surface area of RustHDL is large, and it needs tons of documentation.  This is the main goal for the forseable future.
    * The crates need to be reorganized.  I originally had a series of smaller crates, but that gets to be a pain during development.  Now that things
      have mostly stabilized, smaller crates lead to faster compile times, and a better feature-controlled user experience.
    * Macros need to be documented, like `dff_setup`.
- Tutorials on the BSPs and using Hardware.  While its fun to play with simulations, the real hardware is generally more ~~frustrating~~ satisfying.
I have the following boards on hand (or used to), so I can do a basic tutorial on each of these as I go.
    * Alchitry Cu - this is an inexpensive ICE40-based board that can be programmed using only open source tools.  Probably one of the least expensive
    ways to get started.  I have a few of these, and I'd like to use them as the primary platform for the simple examples.
    * Alchitry Au - this is far more powerful, and includes the DDR and an Artix-7 FPGA.  You need to use commercial toolchains for this, but it's
    still reasonably priced for an FPGA board.
    * Orange Crab - this is a fun board based on the Lattice ECP5, and includes a LPDDR and a super-small form factor.  It can also be targetted with
    open source tools.
    * [OpalKelly](www.opalkelly.com) XEM6010 - an oldie, but great FPGA SOM based on the workhorse Spartan-6 from Xilinx.  The toolchain is way deprecated.
    I think this thing is great, but you can't get it anymore.  So...
    * [OpalKelly](www.opalkelly.com) XEM7010 - the modern version of the XEM6010.  Includes an Artix-7 and DDR.  RustHDL wraps the `FrontPanel` API to
    make working with OpalKelly modules easier to use.
    * Lattice ECP5 development board
    * More...?
- Analysis
    * I have the start of a timing analysis module in process in RustHDL.  I would like to finish it.  It constructs a full dataflow analysis of your
    design, and then looks for unprotected time-domain crossings.
- Make a `1.0.0` release.  This will be an official release, and then breaking changes will become more painful.  So it needs to be done
when there is a significant stability in the design.  I do not intend to make any substantial changes before releasing `1.0.0`.  Just documentation
and tweaks to improve usability.
- Future releases will focus on a richer set of widgets and more analytics.
- DSP blocks
    * FFT - at the least a basic decimation-in-time FFT engine written in RustHDL
    * CORDIC - arctangent's in hardware, baby!
    * FIR filters - I have one now, but it doesn't really synthesize properly on Lattice FPGAs
- Nanoprocessors
    * A number of applications would benefit from the hardware-reuse of a processor, but do not need/want
    the overhead of a full blown uC (like a RISC-V core).  For those, it would be nice to be able to
    define state machines with reusable ALUs and other micro-processor-like features.
- Communication Bridges
    * FPGAs with buttons and LEDs are definitely cool.  But even better are FPGAs that can serve as low-drama, high speed compute
    engines.  To do that, you need to get data in and out of them at speed.  USB is one choice.  But what about Ethernet, PCI-e, etc?
- Backend
    * I have run into a depressing number of bugs in commercial toolchains.  So I would like to start to move synthesis into
    RustHDL itself.  Yeah - I'm nuts.
- Place-and-route
    * [NextPNR](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) is awesome.  I ran into problems trying to use it in one of my larger designs.  I'm not sure what to do about that.
    

# References

RustHDL was inspired by and borrows from the following awesome projects!  They are listed in
no particular order...

- LucidHDL is a very cool HDL developed by the folks over at [alchitry](https://www.alchitry.com).  I initially
started writing tooling to manipulate Lucid using Rust, and then realized that it would be better for
me to just use Rust itself.  But there is some great stuff on their website, and their book is excellent.
- AlchitryLabs is a n IDE from [alchitry](https://www.alchitry.com) that supports the LucidHDL.  They open sourced 
it and it is an impressive piece of software.
- For Python fans, [MyHDL](myhdl.org) is a Python based approach to generating HDL.  If you consider yourself a Python person, check it out.  After I left Verilog, I first rewrote a fair chunk of firmware using MyHDL and Python.  In the end, it wasn't for me, but many of the ideas are very cleanly expressed.
- _The_ open source toolchain that started it all is [IceStorm](https://clifford.at/icestorm) Open Source tool chain for the `iCE 40` FPGA, and an incredibly powerful concept.  In particular, Claire's work demonstrated a software-like path for handling FPGAs that was critical to a number of open source FPGA-centric projects. 
- [YoSys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) is the Verilog synthesis suite used by [RustHDL] to 
process generated Verilog and check a design for potential errors (static analysis).  
- [Icarus](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) is a verilog simulator that is software based, open source
and easy to use.  Before [RustHDL] got it's own simulator, I would write and simulate everything
using [Icarus].
- [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) I'd condsider this the professional option
for simulation (particularly of super complicated designs).  [RustHDL] doesn't come anywhere near
the simulation performance of [Verilator] yet, but the goal is to either generate Verilog that
[Verilator] can process, or adopt the same types of techniques described by the author in this 
[paper](https://veripool.org/papers/Verilator_Internals1_202010.pdf).
